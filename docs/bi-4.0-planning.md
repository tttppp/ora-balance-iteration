# BI-4.0 Planning

Discussion about balance going into BI-4.0.


## General

### Scaling

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: the scaling changes, i dont want to list specific numbers but i think we could touch scaling too

### Bullet Speed

* i like men - 2022-06-02: I would definitely not add bullet speed to rifles. I don't think it would improve any interactions and I think it would be rather annoying
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: bullet speed for rifles would not be good with how movement and subcell works. if damage is consistent in infantry vs infantry, then i think i would be fine with testing it now we have the facing changes
* Longely - 2022-06-02: i wasnt planning to add it to anything, since it would be very controversial. but its no secret im not a fan of the bullet speed removal

### Crushing

* Pinkthoth - 2022-06-02: I think RA would benefit from including CA's feature where vehicles slow down when they are crushing infantry
* Blackened - 2022-06-02: I'd be okay with that but maybe not such a hard slowdown
* Duke Bones - 2022-06-02: But what about those NASTY early game LV crushes smh
* Gacius - 2022-06-02: that is annoying and shouldnt exist
* tux - 2022-06-02: I hate thohse. complete rng
* Pun - 2022-06-27: Add a significant slowdown on crushes and make crush rate 100%
* Longely - 2022-06-27: i tested the oposite 100% dodge chance, i think something like what you suggest here should probably be tested separately since it really affects everything else

### Veterancy

* ZxGanon - 2022-08-09: Veterancy in Red Alert 1 feels like an afterthought right now. Reaching each stage requires ridiculous amounts of value to kill while providing almost no boni to make it worth keeping your units a live. Suggestion: Removing 1 veterancy level to only have to work with 3 (like it is in all Command and Conquers)
* i like men - 2022-08-09: personally I am not a fan of veterancy at all especially not in RA. I don't think it really adds anything. all it does it really increase snowballing, so I think buffing it would be counterproductive
* SarahSicaria - 2022-08-09: I think the biggest issue with increasing veterency bonuses is the snowballing factor but these changes seem very reasonable to me. The speed differences are the biggest downfall to the current veterancy system
* Orb - 2022-08-09: I think the vet 1 on spy is more significant with infantry than vehicles
* Pun - 2022-08-24: \[We should also consider\] reworking veterancy
* Longely - 2022-08-24: im really against buffing veterancy for all the reason mention in the thread by ILM and others

### Gems

* Blackened - 2022-08-24: ok i got a radical idea actually, make gems just be double ore in everyway. Right now gem mines produce faster and have less density than ore. The next result ends up being they are worth like 1.80 ore patches


## Defences

### Base Defences

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i dont think base defences have been that dominant this season (but maybe players disagree?), but i still think pill box is overperforming a little. Punsho tested a pretty big increase in reload delay some time back and seemed like it worked pretty well, so i think we should nerf pill box a little by increasing reload delay
* i like men - 2022-06-02: adding a new armor type for base defences. I know back then Pun made the argument that it would probably be better for us to work with what we already had and I don't disagree with that, but seeing as TD has now done it too I actually think we should really consider doing it here as well becuase it does give us more freedom
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: oo thats a good one. i really think we should do that now td has done it too
* Pun - 2022-06-02: Before changing their armour type, we should consider what do we actually want to do with it. I can think of only 2 potentially worthwhile changes: tanks do less damage to defences. aircraft do less damage to defences. well, another one could be a big reduction to anti-inf defence damage, and also reduction in rocket soldier damage to defences. When it comes to artillery I do think arty needs to have a bit higher anti-defence damage. But that change doesn't require a new armour type at all
* Upps - 2022-06-02: About adding concrete Armor for defences im a fan of that. -making tanks a lot better against defences. -making BH/Yak a lot worse against defences. I would exclude Migs and Longbows for this. -making rocket Soldier worse to defences.

### Gap Generator

* Pun - 2022-06-02: I think gap generation could receive a +1 cell range buff


## Infantry

### Rockets

* Moods - 2022-06-28: i suggested making the allies rocketman unique in the sense that it gets longer AA range.
* SarahSicaria - 2022-06-28: I think the rocket soldier should stay universal. It still wouldn't be viable as they are really slow

### Flamers

* i like men - 2022-06-02: It's no secret that I wanted to rework flamer or grenadier, but seeing how well despro has been using flamers I would kind of just like to leave them alone for now
* Longely - 2022-06-02: yeah, i was actually planning to rework the flammer a bit. but despro kinda proved they allready are pretty usefull in the cases i wanted it to be good in.

### Grenadiers

* tux - 2022-06-02: oh yeah how about removing chain explosions from grens
* Gacius - 2022-06-03: if dog ate a grenadier, should dog explode as well from death damage of gren?
* Pun - 2022-06-03: I'm not sure what grenades you've seen people eat, but they defo shouldn't detonate

### Dogs

* dang_shot - 2022-06-30: keep in mind widow also asked about dogs and mammoths (i think both are fine, but could maybe do something with dogs if you want to)
* despro - 2022-06-30: theyre fine imo
* i like men - 2022-06-30: Anyway dogs seem fine to me but to be perfectly honest I haven't seen that much of them so I can't comment too much on them. I did see that they were not used that much in RAGL though but that does not necessarily mean they suck, I guess they are just rather situational

### Tanya

* despro - 2022-06-02: oh and make tanya 2 shot inf instead of 1 but i had been warned there are some proper tanya fanboys, fun unit but lmao that design
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i think cnc players like her but it seems like a lot of the players coming from other games arent fan of her design
* Longely - 2022-06-02: I have made several test with 2 shots, its sounds good on paper but there is issues. like medics for instance working as a 100% counter to her
* i like men - 2022-06-02: You could just make her do 2 shots quick and then a delay. Anyway I'm not going to pick a side here, but if you decide to nerf her you should probably revert the cost increase
* despro - 2022-06-30: tanya stronk most annoying thing is the reliance on her, a lot of allies vs allies games feel like it all comes down to tanya snipes. and ye its just constant having to snipe her since it takes no time to rebuild her
* Pinkthoth - 2022-06-30: Tanya paradrop could work if you create a proxy actor that you build instead of Tanya. I wonder if it would be possible to make Tanya buildable with delayed drop similiar to how vehicles are peoduced by Nod. It's also possible to create a cooldown for Tanya with a visual timer such as support powers have. I did that in my balance suggestions last year, but ppl who played it didn't like it


## Vehicles

### Ranger

* despro - 2022-06-02: increase hp of rangers
* i like men - 2022-06-02: Hopefully not a [buff to] vision
* Pun - 2022-08-24: +1 on making ranger tankyer

### Light Tank

* SarahSicaria - 2022-06-28: And in regards to allies not having anyway of dealing with aircraft early game, how would people feel about the LT having AA capabilities? Maybe the same damage as the flak but half the rate of fire so the DPS is less to compensate for it having more armor?
* Moods - 2022-06-28: Ill be honest the LT was the last thing i had in mind , not that its a bad idea i jus think it might actually be too good. Hinds and yaks   stuggle too kill them efficiently and they keep up with hinds speed wise so theres that
* netMan - 2022-07-06: maybe light tank can use a price reduction or armour damage increase. at this state its just a tanky flak truck that is alot less useful
* Gacius - 2022-07-06: Nope. Lt is good as it is
* Longely - 2022-07-06: im not sure its good as it.. besides early cheese and early oil game they are pretty much none existing. Making them more viable trough out the whole game would be nice, if possible. I agree they certaintly do not need a buff vs wood armor
* Pun - 2022-07-06: I think LT standalone can be buffed in 2 ways, buff against wood and heavy armour. Not as drastic as I did in the LV revamp but the buff should still be pretty significant. if not standalone, then I think LV's should grant 1 cell more vision and cost a little less. for them to be actually comparable to other later options, cause now there's not even a contest
* Longely - 2022-07-06: I think wood armour is a bit dangerous for early cheese. but Heavy armor i think could could be a good buff. we are testing that next balance test
* i like men - 2022-07-06: I don't know, despro seems to do a lot of non cheese LT builds. I'm not necessarily opposed to adjusting them but don't think they are as weak/irrelevant as you do
* .won - 2022-07-06: i just dont see anything to gain by buffing them, especially since they are an early game unit. You open it up to having crazy LT rush builds.
* Sara Sicaria - 2022-07-07: dont touch the light tank, its in a good spot.
* (Not) New - 2023-07-17: Maybe a small reduction in the health and speed of light tanks?
* .won - 2023-07-17: Prob just adding a husk would solve a lot. The issues is crushes
* Pun - 2023-07-17: revert the hp buff, increase vision by a cell and slightly increase anti-heavy
* .won - 2023-07-17: Too much. Create other issues
* tux - 2023-07-17: they can already harrass harvesters in groups of 3

### Mobile Flak

* Pun - 2022-07-06: I think we should also double mobile flak anti-heavy 10 -> 20. it wouldn't be much. but makes the unit feel better vs units like apc
* Longely - 2022-07-06: also have an effect on light tank/flak relationship.. but its so low that im not sure it makes a difference
* tux - 2023-07-17: plsno
* Pun - 2023-07-17: speaking of flak, I'd also like to see both flak and ranger be buffed vs infantry
* Blackened - 2023-07-18: I think we can fiddle around with flaks/LT with the new speed system so that Flaks don't straight die to LT because they can't really outrun them

### Medium Tank

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: we should implement the small cost increase to medium tanks that bain balance pushed for a long time ago but never got around to, the change but be felt directly by players but it makes the hp/cost more even for medium and heavy tanks and there were some concern from a few players that mediums were better. i think this change is just a formality that should have been added back when the hp of mediums were reduced to 46000 from 47000 (after being increased from 45000)

### MCV

* Sara Sicaria - 2022-07-07: Whatever happened to reducing the MCV cost to $1600 btw? because iirc the MCV build time is boosted to be built in the equivalent time of a $1600 unit right? and its the only unit left with boosted build time right?
* Unano - 2022-07-07: Does sound like a good change
* Longely - 2022-07-07: I dont have any problems with testing that again, Unless theres any objections?.... Anjew?
* tux - 2022-07-07: I mean I'm not for or against the change really. it would make things more consistent and give you a bit more money but I don't see anything wrong with it currently

### Artillery

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: punsho tested a more mobile artillery with less range, i dont know the exact numbers but i think this was a good design, i think it has a positive impact on stalemates (allies vs allies) because it becomes a little easier to snipe them due to reduced range but also it makes the unit feel better to control for the player

### Mobile Radar Jammer

* Sigil - 2022-07-01: Naturally saccing yaks to kill MRJ is worth too
* Pun - 2022-07-01: Problem is that yaks do quite pathetic damage to mrj. So you need to sack a ton
* .won - 2022-07-01: yeah i agree mrj armor is kinda insane. especially to yaks
* dang_shot - 2022-07-01: we have talked before about making it light armor before maybe we should try to test it. i agree that it can be bit awkward to snipe
* Pun - 2022-07-01: IMO mrj is fine as is, I'd rather we focus on more interesting / important balance changes
* Sarah Sicaria - 2022-07-01: I think it should be left alone
* despro - 2022-07-01: dont touch jammers pls
* Sigil - 2022-07-01: I think it's fine as is balance wise. Design, it feels really frustrating to have your army doing no damage because you can't snipe one unit

### Phase Transport

* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: someone suggested making phase transport a little stronger in combat and i think i would like to see that too, just need to be very careful not to overtune it because of the stealth
* Ekanim - 2022-07-06: Making LTs + Flaks have some range of stealth detection for phase tanks. Maybe changing phase armor to resemble TTs, if flaks and LTs aren’t already a good counter. This increases the purpose of these vehicles in late game, which can already be used for artillery flanks and anti-TT. The balance of the phase might need to be changed to increase its use after this nerf. Possible one or both: -increased vision to help avoid the new threat and be a late game multipurpose scout -increase the damage/capabilities of the weapon, making a group of them good for eco raids or even attacking out-of-position armor units. (I think this is going to be in the next release anyway)
* Pun - 2022-07-06: It has 7 cells of range, which is the same as ranger, highest vision vehicle in the game. Phase is currently broken on release but it's fine on balance maps
* .won - 2022-07-06: yeah I agree, i dont think we need to do anything, Phase transport is very niche, 1 faction gets it. It unclocks when unloading, and you are either using it to drop off something in a base, which usually have static d, or bringing it onto the field with tanya. Inf have 1 cell detection already.
* Blackened - 2022-07-06: Infantry detection is completely unreliable. Needs like a half cell increase at least. \[Image showing dogs vs thieves\]
* Longely - 2022-07-06: I agree with Mint. i do think more things should have stealth detection. and i also wouldn't mind if it had other use cases then just being transport

### Mobile Gap Generator

* Moods - 2022-06-30: While we are at it when are we going too tackle mgg... heres an idea.. have it replace radar jammer for england  entirely.. make it slightly cheaper then RJ and have it have the jammer AND shroud effect
* i like men - 2022-06-30: Don't think it makes much sense to make it cheaper on top of it. Especially not since RJ are already built often
* Pun - 2022-06-30: Just just buff shroud radius by 1 cell. For both mgg and gg

### Chronotank

* Orb - 2022-07-06: I'd rather see Chronotank get some attention than phase transport
* tux - 2022-07-06: Well we could make it fire even if it’s facing backwards. Then give the missiles more turn speed and a bit more range
* Orb - 2022-07-06: giving it some firing tolerance might not be crazy
* Blackened - 2022-07-07: chrono tanks are actually pretty decent. The just get countered pretty good by tesla tanks, and air to a certain extent. They're biggest problem is they get completely shut down by mrj. But so does any tracked missile.
* Mees - 2022-07-07: Their ability to splash infantry is both good an fun to use
* Moods - 2022-07-07: I think biggest issue is there light armor. Id like too see heavy armor cronotanks tht have AA capability, but a big damage nerf and cost incresse
* Orb - 2022-07-07: Teleporting AA units not exactly the easiest to balance. Light armor grants resistance to anti-heavy damage, it's not necessarily bad. You could always increase their health if that is the main concern
* Pun - 2022-08-24: Chorno Tanks share some of the issues of Tesla Tank. They don't synergise well with army compositions. It does its job really well but regular rocket soldiers + tanks do that job just as well in most cases. The other issue is that you can't attack move them, if they target infantry all of their damage is lost. Chrono crushing as a concept isn't great.

### Mammoths

* upps - 2022-06-02: Depends on the Match up I think their AA is often to good to stop them with airforce special with longbows. Allies struggle more then Soviets. And without own tier 3 they are really in a bad spot. In a SvS I often questioning, if you even should go for Mammoths because HT are often the better choice
* Mees - 2022-06-02: I think the limited speed really degrades the mammoth usefullness due to ever growing map size in 1v1 maps. In XvsX theyre very good
* Pun - 2022-06-02: I'd like 1 thing to happen, for mammoths to lose the ability to one-shot yaks. That can be done either by slightly decreasing anti-light damage or increasing yak health. Apart from that, mammoth rework could be reducing the cost of mammoth (perhaps to 1700) and decreasing anti-heavy accordingly
* dang_shot - 2022-06-02: i think mammoths are fine, dont think i would change them at the moment. actually pun's idea isnt that bad
* Longely - 2022-06-02: like bassicly mammuths have insane turnspeed compared to its size lol, so it forces the turret off target when retreating.. and other then looking ridiculess also means you loose target
* Orb - 2022-06-02: I'd like mammoths to get some of their range back. They were fun to micro but got nerfed into the ground. If you have to compensate by lowering their HP or something, so be it
* i like men - 2022-06-02: Hm I have to disagree with that, I really did not like their long range personally. I felt the tusk missiles gave too much control
* despro - 2022-06-30: theyre fine imo
* Moods - 2022-06-30: i think mammoths cud use a change they just seem so underwhelming these days. What i was gunna say was decrease AA tusk range and increase anti INF tusk range by a bit
* Pun - 2022-06-30: that range cannot be increased. It was super broken when it was longer
* i like men - 2022-06-30: Mammoths are performing pretty well Moods (based on RAGL stats at least). I don't think reworking them is a terrible idea, but I would definitely also be against reverting tusk range nerf. The range was absurd before in my opinion
* Sigil - 2022-06-30: On mammoths, they do feel a bit underwhelming but they were busted a few releases ago. I'd actually like to see the turret rotation speed. increased over anything else, they don't feel very microable. increasing tusk range would make them oppressive in soviet mirrors I think
* Orb - 2022-06-30: Mammoths aren't that good in Soviet mirrors, they just die to heavy tanks. I mean you can still mix them in, but spamming them wasn't good, even at their peak

### Demo Truck

* i like men - 2022-06-02: But I still have suggestions though. Like I still really want to reduce the radius of demo trucks. I think that should have been the nerf and not the hp change

### MAD Tank

* Longely - 2022-06-02: i think its good to add in regardless of knowing exactly what at the current moment. the madtank potential is pretty good in itself imo
* Pun - 2022-06-02: I don't think we should do anything with mad tank. As a concept is just is not fun. It's a poor man's demo truck
* Longely - 2022-06-02: the main difference between madtank and demo is that demo is usefull against army, and very rarely buildings. where madtanks sucks vs army but are semi good vs buildings, making them good was army kinda does make them a demo truck clone
* Mees - 2022-06-02: I think theres no way to balance mad tanks without making them OP in chokey team games. Unless chronoing becomes impossible or smt like that
* Moods - 2023-06-05: Chrono mads are already broken. I agree madtanks should have a role... but this aint it lol
* tttppp - 2023-06-06: We talked about this previously and one suggestion was to set the time of the chrono and MAD tank so that it comes back before exploding
* Orb - 2023-06-06: If it was truely oppressive you'd see it in 2vs2's, but we don't.

### Tesla Tank

* Blackened - 2022-06-02: tesla tanks need less vision. change it to the same as every other tank besides ranger/phase. and air is pretty easily countered considering tesla tanks would give flaks full aa range
* Longely - 2022-06-02: isnt that kinda what makes them different? i know its super good. but.. it also sucks to have all units feel the same
* Pun - 2022-06-02: we will have to touch tesla tank at some point. It's crushing just has to go
* Orb - 2022-06-02: Crushing would not be an issue if IC didn't exist
* Pun - 2022-08-24: IMO Tesla Tank has main 3 issues: They don't synergise with other unit queues. Secondly Tesla Tank damage is incredibly low. Lastly tesla tanks depend on snowballing, TT's provide so little value standalone that unless you have many of them providing value all other units just just prove more useful.
* SarahSicaria - 2022-08-24: I think their speed and range plays a big part in making use of them too
* Longely - 2022-08-24: Regarding TT and Chrono i dont really disagree with your analysis, those where kinda the issues i had in mind
* tux - 2023-07-17: ic tesla tanks are just free engagement win lol
* .won - 2023-07-17: Ic anything is a free win. But I don’t think removing the crushing is good. I would just say make them a bit slower. The issue is the counter to tt doesn’t work well. LT get blasted before they are in range
* Pun - 2023-07-17: Tesla Tank is supposed to be a poke / artillery units, something you widdle your enemy away with over a long period of time. [...] because the IC version of the unit is that strong the non-IC version needs to be weak to compensate
* dang_shot - 2023-07-17: o yes just to avoid confusion i obviously believe we should compensate if we remove crushing. not just leave it as it is because that would probably kill off the unit. and i agree with punsho about the design
* Orb - 2023-07-17: just reduce their speed. we've already done it once and it really pushed their viability down. removing crushing is boring. [...] you can IC any unit, APC does the same thing but better
* dang_shot - 2023-07-17: i actually think the opposite personally
* tttppp - 2023-07-17: IC with APCs seems better for crushing than IC with TTs. TTs cost 1350 and APCs cost 850
* Pun - 2023-07-17: I don't agree with the analysis. The difference is that apc is a comital unit, it has very little value if it is not in a life or death situation. While TT's do have value in neutral, it can stay at range and still be usefull
* Mint - 2023-07-17: I think the two suggested options for Teslas look interesting and my thoughts on them. 1. Reduce speed - easier to hunt and kill. less crushes I guess but probably more of a minor effect. 2. Remove crushing and buff (presumably increase ROF or damage?) - total specialization as a poking unit. I think you might want to consider reducing speed slightly in this scenario too, since they can be a tad easier to hunt and kill. TTs can be annoying and unsatisfying to play against sometimes when you can’t catch them before they reach cover.  Blackhawks can have trouble getting to them. I think both options are fine, 1. Reducing speed is the smallest change possible that might fix the issue; 2 is more interesting.
* anjew - 2023-07-18: You can kill defence structures while crushing which an APC could never do
* Blackened - 2023-07-18: a little late to the party but I feel like yall are missing the point at what makes TT so strong. Taking away crushing doesn't solve anything. Making them slower doesn't do too much other than making LT a little better (but still bad) against them. In 1v1 what makes TT so strong in the rush is the IC. [...] All that said, the best way to nerf TT imo is their HP. Right now they can tank just enough to get IC'd and swing a battle. A BH/yak/Longbow expend their whole ammo supply to kill 1 TT which means you can't just go air 1:1. You need more. Lowering HP also means a single LT will kill a TT in 1 on 1 (Though this is rare to happen.) It also means standard rifles/rockets will fair a little better.
* dang_shot - 2023-07-18: what makes the ic and tesla tank combination so strong is the added crushing on top of it as you it makes you able to deal with everything the opponent have, like if you ic apc you can still crush very well but you arent going to be sniping artilleries. i dont disagree about changing ic, but i very much think removing crushing will have be a nerf to tesla tank rushing and i think without crushing its going to kill it off unless you provide a counter buff.
* Upps - 2023-07-18: When you suggest changing TT reducing the turnrate can also do wonders combined with a speed nerf. If your really consider removing crushing then it need weapon buffs like that it acts like  the stationary teslacoil, but maybe  with less damage. Or make them charge first before they shoot
* (Not) New - 2023-07-18: Some ideas for what new stuff could be added to TT's as a counter buff after removing IC: An EMP blast, as a unit ability, with cooldown, that would temporarily disable enemy vehicles and/or static defenses. A Secondary weapon that deals AoE. An electric forcefield, as a unit ability, with cooldown, that provides temporary damage reduction

### Minelayers

* Orb - 2023-07-01: So I always thought Minelayers should have a weapon that can target mines, but I just thought of something maybe better? Minelayers could detonate enemy mines and be immune to mine damage. so you just run them over minefields
* tux - 2023-07-01: Makes mine clearing a bit too easy no
* Darkademic - 2023-07-01: did this for CA  (tho we do have more ways of delivering mines, so more of a need for it) [Image of minelayer with progress bar to kill a mine]
* tux - 2023-07-01: Ohh with cooldown. That's cool


## Air

* Pun - 2022-08-24: we should also consider the idea of making aircraft chronoshiftable and iron curtainable

### Yaks

* despro - 2022-06-27: they are still bonkers at times now but just wish their behaviour was more consistent if it requires a slight nerf then so be it
* Longely - 2022-06-27: yaks vs infantry have been discussed many times, as punsho said main problem is lack of alied mobile AA, which people also tried to solve many times
* despro - 2022-06-27: when a-moving they sometimes strafe whole blob other time just attack 1
* Longely - 2022-06-27: nah, they dont really have strafing mechanics. they shoot the same target till its dead
* Pun - 2022-06-27: They just can't be consistent vs infantry
* ilikemen - 2022-06-27: Of course you can make them more consistent if you nerf them Pun. We should just consider exploring the strafing again, pretty sure this was always the plan but we weren't sure how to nerf it. I think we could revisit that
* Pun - 2022-06-27: It's likely just yak aquiring a target that it can't kill in the strafe it's currently doing. The problem was that we want yak to be a sniper
* ilikemen - 2022-06-27: Oh that's true I remember - needs to be able to snipe arties and tanya
* Orb - 2022-06-27: Don't change the Yak/V2 interaction. You'd be smoothing out yet another interesting wrinkle
* ilikemen - 2022-06-27: I'm not saying to change anything, I'm just giving examples of why it is unreliable
* Longely - 2022-06-27: yeah i guess inconsistent and unreliable also isnt the same thing
* Blackened - 2022-06-27: Yaks have 2 guns. Sometimes only 1 gun is in range so they dong deliver the damage they should
* Ekanim - 2022-06-27: Why not give yaks 1 gun?
* Orb - 2022-06-27: The attack weapon is completely changed from RA so it doesn't really matter how we change
* Sigil - 2022-06-27: would like to see \[strafing] back with less damage to infantry while still retaining the ability to snipe a tanya
* SarahSicaria - 2022-06-28: I definitely agree about the yak is very inconsistent. Its another reason why i dont play soviets. I wouldnt mind seeing opportunity fire reintroduced with certain nerfs to stop it from being OP, maybe reduced speed + cost increase to 1500


## Naval

* Pun - 2022-08-24: [We should change this]

There was quite a lot more discussion as Blackened, Mo and Pun all tried to create a naval balance patch.


## Support Powers

### Parabombs

* Blackened - 2022-06-02: parabombs should also kill a tanya if they miss by 1 cell.

### Iron Curtain

* despro - 2022-06-03: u guys talked about ic earlier so just curious and this might be a tux tier idea, but what if u changed ic to a 2x2 square? this could be a small nerf since 1 less tank plus it would make it easier to hit a moving tank, think its a tad annoying to target moving tanks at least
* i like men - 2022-06-03: it's not the worst idea, but could be I am missing something
* Blackened - 2022-06-03: i wouldnt find that nerf to ic but that doesn't really do much. besides the 5 ic apc/tesla crush it really only take 1 tank to route an army
* .won - 2022-06-03: the net code fix prob will solve a lot of issues
* Blackened - 2023-07-18: I also think IC should not be 1500 but at least 2500. Maybe 3000.

### Chronoshift

* Blackened - 2022-08-24: what if chronosphere allowed you to chronoshift ships onto land without killing them. imagine 5 cruisers showing up anywhere every 2 minutes
* Pun - 2022-08-24: same would need to be allowed for chrono shifting vehicles onto water / cliffs. Although it would make chronoshift worth building it would be terrible mechanic. It's just a haha you didn't keep your units scattered at all times and now you lost them all
* SarahSicaria - 2022-08-24: A while ago I floated the idea of making the chronosphere lock to the selected units rather than the selected tiles. And people say the IC and chrono should counter eachother, currently the IC can counter the chrono but its almost impossible to counter the IC with the chrono
* Blackened - 2022-08-24: countering ic with chrono right now involves chronoing ic units almost immediately after they get ic'd
* Pun - 2022-08-24: let's not forget that we still want german chrono to become allied chrono
* SarahSicaria - 2022-08-24: Yes but fixing the chrono on a more fundamental level maybe mean that wouldnt be necessary, or if it is, could even be changed to a 3x3 square
* Pun - 2023-05-25: [To see this more we'd need Chronosphere on a] reduced tech level
* Unano - 2023-05-25: German chrono is actually good and under used imo
* Hans - 2023-05-25: how about germany has a cool-down buff rather than the number of chrono units buff? [...] and germany has the cool-down buff or price advantage or other ones as a sub-faction
* anjew - 2023-05-25: [To see this more we'd need] the average length of the game to go longer
* Moods - 2023-05-25: if we want chrono to become more popular , it needs a radius overhaul. A circular radius [...] That selects units within the circle at random( if over the 5 or 13 limit ) and doesnt lose target due to leaving proximity [...] Also yeah circle is stupid a square would be much better
* Gacius - 2023-05-25: I agree with moods. It is real pain to set up units in formation where we can have circle selection method
* .won - 2023-05-25: the set up for chrono isnt the issue is thats you cant use chrono for defensive purposes because it misfires
* dang_shot - 2023-05-25: if you are able to get more tanks into the circle than you can send it makes it random
* Blackened - 2023-05-25: No rng on my chronosphere please. Don't need that level of salt in my life
* Pun - 2023-05-25: Instead of random, it could be closest to the center
* Orb - 2023-05-25: I suggest changing the behavior if chrono targets an enemy unit. it puts them in stasis
* anjew - 2023-05-26: the power itself is questionably useful. you need to be able to take out more value than the tanks are worth in case you lose them
* TermX - 2023-05-26: i'd focus first on fixing this chrono "bug": when you select some moving tanks and chrono them, the chrono is activated but it teleports less tanks than the ones which were selected (e.g. vs tanks IC'ed). It would be better if it teleports all the tanks which were first selected and not only the ones which are in the "chrono area" when the chrono is activated.
* Moods - 2023-05-26: Im.sure itd be built alot moee if it was 50 power lol
* Moods - 2023-05-27: England - stable chrono = 5 units that are PERMANATELY teleported to a destination. France - unstable chrono = 5 units teleported TEMPORARILY (like how it is now) BUT with a slight chance of spawning in chronostorm where the vehicles should have been teleported too. Germany - Advanced chronosphere = 13 units temporarily ( unchanged from now )
